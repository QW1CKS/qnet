## 🤝 Code of Conduct

QNet is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive environment for all contributors. We follow a code of conduct based on our [Constitution](../qnet-spec/memory/constitution.md) principles:

- **Respect**: Treat all contributors with respect and professionalism
- **Inclusion**: Welcome diverse perspectives and backgrounds
- **Collaboration**: Work together constructively toward common goals
- **Quality**: Maintain high standards in all contributions
- **Transparency**: Communicate openly and honestly

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Required Tools:**
- **Rust 1.70+** with Cargo
- **Go 1.21+** (for linter development)
- **Git** with LFS support
- **Docker** (for builds and testing)

**Platform-Specific Requirements:**

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2022
winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools -e

# Install Rust (if not already installed)
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
```

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qnet.git
   cd qnet
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/QW1CKS/qnet.git
   ```

2. **Initial Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   cargo fetch

   # Build the workspace
   cargo build --workspace

   # Run tests
   cargo test --workspace
   ```

3. **Verify Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Check that everything works
   cargo run -p stealth-browser --features with-tauri
   ```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Choose a Task

Review available tasks in our [Task Tracker](qnet-spec/specs/001-qnet/tasks.md):

```bash
# View current tasks
cat qnet-spec/specs/001-qnet/tasks.md | grep -A 5 "T[0-9]"
```

**Task Priority Levels:**
- 🔴 **High**: Critical for current milestone
- 🟡 **Medium**: Important for next milestone
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice-to-have features

### 2. Understand Requirements

**Mandatory Reading:**
- **[Constitution](../qnet-spec/memory/constitution.md)**: Core project principles
- **[AI Guardrail](../qnet-spec/memory/ai-guardrail.md)**: Code quality standards
- **[Testing Rules](../qnet-spec/memory/testing-rules.md)**: Testing requirements
- **[Specification](qnet-spec/specs/001-qnet/spec.md)**: Technical requirements

## 🔄 Recent Architectural Changes

### DHT Removal (November 2025)

QNet migrated from libp2p Kademlia DHT to operator peer directory for peer discovery:

**Reason**: DHT bootstrap timeouts on Windows/NAT environments blocked user adoption. With 6 operator nodes already running for exits, DHT infrastructure became redundant.

**Migration**: Flag day deployment (all nodes updated within 1 week window)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **18x faster connections** (<5s vs 90s DHT timeout)
- ✅ **Predictable performance** (no NAT/firewall bootstrap issues)
- ✅ **Geographic routing** (smart relay selection by country)
- ✅ **Simpler codebase** (removed ~450 lines of DHT code)

**Discovery Model**:
- **Centralized Discovery**: 6 operator nodes maintain HTTP peer directory
- **Decentralized Operation**: Relay peers forward encrypted packets (P2P)
- **Registration**: Relay nodes POST heartbeat every 30s to `/api/relay/register`
- **Query**: Clients GET peer list from `/api/relays/by-country` on startup

**Implementation Details**: See `research/dht-removal/COMPREHENSIVE_DHT_REMOVAL_RESEARCH.md`

**Precedent**: Tor (9 directory authorities), Bitcoin (DNS seeds), IPFS (Protocol Labs bootnodes) all use operator infrastructure for discovery while maintaining decentralized operation.

### 3. Follow TDD Workflow

QNet uses **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

```bash
# 1. Write failing test first
cargo test --lib [crate_name]

# 2. Implement minimal solution
cargo build

# 3. Verify test passes
cargo test --lib [crate_name]

# 4. Refactor and optimize
cargo test --workspace
```

Please review `../qnet-spec/memory/ai-guardrail.md` and `../qnet-spec/memory/testing-rules.md` before any change. Include `AI-Guardrail: PASS` and `Testing-Rules: PASS` in commit messages after completing the checklists.

- Map each change to `qnet-spec/specs/001-qnet` requirements/tasks.
- Write tests first where feasible. Keep code idiomatic and simple.
- Run `cargo build` and `cargo test` before opening PRs; ensure tests follow the rules in `testing-rules.md`.

## Windows prerequisites
- Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 (C++ workload) and Windows 10/11 SDK.
- Use the "Developer PowerShell for VS 2022" when building locally.
- If you hit `LNK1181: cannot open input file 'kernel32.lib'`, add a Windows SDK in the Build Tools installer and retry.
